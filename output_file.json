This position is ideally suited to a strong programmer wishing to apply their skills to understanding biological neural networks. We are interested in how computations arise from the organization and connectivity of neuronal... networks. To analyze neural circuit structure and function at highest resolution and completeness possible, we combine large-scale structural and functional imaging techniques including high-throughput electron and X-ray microscopy, and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. We seek a software engineer with strong programming skills and coding experience.
