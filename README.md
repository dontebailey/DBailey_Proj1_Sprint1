**Project Description:** This project simple 
retrieves data from the Google Jobs API
using your API key and saves it to a 
.json file

**How to Use:** You will first need to create a 
new python file and name it "secrets.py"
inside that file you will need to create
a variable name "secret_key" and for its
value you will need to put in your own
API key from SerpAPI and make sure that
the key is wrapped in quotations to make it
a string (you will need to make a SerpAPI 
account if you don't have one so you can
get your own personal API key). Then you 
should be able to run the project fine
after that
